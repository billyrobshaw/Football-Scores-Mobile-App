# Football-Scores-Mobile-App

Overview
Hi there, this is one of my projects I've been creating in my free team. It's a Mobile app developed as a MAUI project using DotNet. The application as of 19/08/24 allows the user to see live football scores and the live standings of the current 24/25 Premier League table. I will be keeping this repos up-to-date with change as I want to expand this project to allow users to search for different leagues and/or teams. 

Code
In the Repos you will see the files LiveScore.xaml and LiveScore.xaml.cs. The LiveScore.xaml is the frontend or the only page as of now for the mobile app and LiveScore.xaml.cs is the backend. Inside of the Services folder you will see two C# files LiveScoreAPI.cs and StandingsAPI.cs. This is where the API's code is (https://live-score-api.com/). As of now I am using a 14 day free trail for the API, so this API maybe changed at a later date. Lastly, in the models folder is two root C# files, Root.cs and StandingRoots.cs. These files store the class's needed when grabbing data from the API request.

Currently this is the look of the mobile app.
